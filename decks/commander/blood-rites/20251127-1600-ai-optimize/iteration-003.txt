## Description
This vampire deck prioritizes answers and interaction over proactive threats. With 11 instants and 9 sorceries, you can respond to opponents' threats at every stage. The removal suite includes premium efficient removal (Path to Exile, Swords to Plowshares, Anguished Unmaking, Utter End), flexible board wipes (Austere Command, Damn, Terror Tide), and instant-speed interaction. The creature base focuses on those that provide additional value when removing threats (Vona can destroy anything, Karlov exiles creatures, Yahenni is indestructible removal). The deck maintains enough aristocrats synergy to close games (Blood Artist, Cruel Celebrant, Vraan) but prioritizes having answers to any threat. This is a control-oriented build that can disrupt combo decks, remove threats, and grind out value.

**Estimated Bracket: 3** - Strong interaction suite with efficient removal, board wipes, tutors (Demonic/Diabolic), powerful card advantage (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena), combo finish (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond/Vito), but plays more reactive/controlling than aggressive.
