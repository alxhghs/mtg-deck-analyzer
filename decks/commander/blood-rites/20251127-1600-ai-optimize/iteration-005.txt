## Description
This vampire deck includes only the highest-power staples and most impactful cards. The manabase features all the best dual lands (Godless Shrine, Fetid Heath, Vault of Champions, Isolated Chapel, Caves of Koilos) with minimal tapped lands. The creature suite focuses on the most powerful payoffs: infinite combo pieces (Vito, Sanguine Bond, Exquisite Blood), doublers (Mondrak, Teysa, Drivnod, Roaming Throne), and the best drain effects (Blood Artist, Cruel Celebrant, Vraan). Card advantage comes from premium engines (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena, Champion of Dusk, Skullclamp). Fast mana and efficient tutors (Sol Ring, Dark Ritual, Demonic Tutor) accelerate the gameplan. Premium removal (Path, Swords, Anguished Unmaking, Austere Command) handles any threat. This is the most optimized, high-power version focused purely on winning efficiently.

**Estimated Bracket: 3-4** - Highest power staples, premium fast mana (Sol Ring, Dark Ritual), efficient tutors (Demonic Tutor), powerful card advantage engines (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena), infinite combo (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond/Vito), premium removal suite, optimized manabase. Borders on Bracket 4 but lacks Mana Crypt, Jeweled Lotus, free counterspells typical of cEDH.
