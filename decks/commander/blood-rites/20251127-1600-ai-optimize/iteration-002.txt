## Description
This vampire aristocrats deck is laser-focused on lifegain-drain synergies and death triggers. The commander creates demon tokens when vampires attack, which feed into the aristocrats engine. The deck includes the powerful infinite combo of Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond (or Vito), multiple drain engines that trigger on lifegain (Vito, Bloodthirsty Conqueror, Karlov), and numerous death-trigger payoffs (Blood Artist, Cruel Celebrant, Vraan, Bastion of Remembrance). Aristocrats enablers (Bartolomé, Viscera Seer, Yahenni, Vampiric Rites) allow you to sacrifice creatures for value. Token doublers (Mondrak, Teysa) and triggered ability doublers (Drivnod, Roaming Throne) amplify your synergies. Every card either creates tokens, triggers on life gain/loss, or creates sacrifice value.

**Estimated Bracket: 3** - Highly synergistic with infinite combo potential (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond/Vito), efficient tutors, powerful engines, strong aristocrats package, but no fast mana beyond Sol Ring and requires setup time.
