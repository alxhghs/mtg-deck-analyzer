## Description
This vampire tribal deck focuses on lifegain-triggers and aristocrats synergies with an optimized mana curve. The commander creates demon tokens when vampires attack. The deck leverages powerful drain engines (Vito, Sanguine Bond, Exquisite Blood) that trigger when you gain life, creating strong synergies with the numerous lifelink creatures and death triggers. Aristocrats elements with sacrifice outlets (Bartolomé, Viscera Seer, Yahenni) provide additional value. The manabase has 37 lands supporting an efficient low-to-mid curve (avg CMC ~3.2), cutting slow 6+ CMC cards and all tapped lands for speed. This build prioritizes curve efficiency over raw power.

**Estimated Bracket: 3** - Optimized casual with efficient tutors (Demonic Tutor), powerful engines (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena), possible infinite combos (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond/Vito), strong interaction, but maintains reasonable mana curve and no fast mana beyond Sol Ring.
