### Creatures (4 cards at 80%)

- **Sorin, Lord of Innistrad** (cut in Iteration 3: Removal Focus) - Makes tokens, no removal

### Artifacts (2 cards at 80%)

- **Myriad Landscape** (cut in Iteration 5: Power Level Focus) - Slow ramp land considered "budget"

---

- **Read the Bones** (40%) - Only kept in: Mana Curve, Card Advantage | Cut from others as budget card draw

---

## Flex Slots Analysis (30-50% Consensus)

These cards appeared in 1-2 iterations and represent genuinely debatable choices:

### Sometimes Included:

- **Orzhov Basilica** (40%) - Kept in: Synergy, Card Advantage | Tapped/bounce land hurts curve and speed

- **Bloodghast** (20%) - Kept in: Mana Curve only | Landfall recursion not core synergy
- **Sanctum Seeker** (20%) - Kept in: Mana Curve only | Combat damage drain not main plan

## Key Insights

### 1. The Core is Remarkably Consistent

**62 cards (63% of the deck) achieved 100% consensus** across all 5 iterations. This means that regardless of whether you prioritize curve, synergy, removal, card advantage, or power level, these cards are essential. This is an incredibly high agreement rate and speaks to the strength of the core strategy.

### 2. The Infinite Combo is Non-Negotiable

Every single iteration kept:

- Exquisite Blood
- Sanguine Bond
- Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose

This combo is the deck's primary win condition and appeared in all 5 analyses without exception.

### 3. Doublers Are Essential

All iterations kept the full suite of doublers:

- **Token Doublers**: Mondrak, Teysa
- **Trigger Doublers**: Drivnod, Roaming Throne

These cards multiply the value of every other card in the deck.

### 4. Tapped Lands Are Universally Bad

Not a single tapped land achieved consensus:

- Thriving Moor, Scoured Barrens, Silverquill Campus, Terramorphic Expanse, Evolving Wilds, Orzhov Basilica, Windbrisk Heights were all cut in every single iteration
- Even Myriad Landscape only appeared in 4/5 (80%)

**Lesson**: Speed matters. Untapped lands are critical.

### 5. Budget Cards Were Consistently Cut

Cards like:

- Epicure of Blood (budget Vito)
- Falkenrath Noble (budget Blood Artist)
- Diabolic Tutor (budget Demonic Tutor)
- Mind Stone / Commander's Sphere (budget ramp)

Were frequently identified as weaker versions of better cards.

### 6. High CMC Cards Need to Be Exceptional

Cards 6+ CMC need to be game-winning:

- ✅ **Kept**: Bolas's Citadel appeared once (power level staple)
- ❌ **Cut**: Order of Sacred Dusk (8 CMC), Butcher (7 CMC), Timothar, Crossway Troublemakers, Patron (all 6 CMC)

Even strong 6+ CMC cards were often cut for being too slow.

### 7. Synergy > Raw Power (Sometimes)

Iteration 2 (Synergy Focus) cut powerful cards that didn't fit:

- Dark Ritual (fast mana but no synergy)
- Forerunner of the Legion (good tutor, not aristocrats)
- Drana (powerful vampire, not drain strategy)

This shows that even strong cards need to fit the deck's gameplan.

### 8. The Deck Needs 36-37 Lands Minimum

All iterations maintained:

- Iteration 1: 37 lands
- Iteration 2: 36 lands
- Iteration 3: 36 lands
- Iteration 4: 37 lands
- Iteration 5: 40 lands (highest, from power level focus wanting premium manabase)

**Average**: 37.2 lands across all iterations

### 9. Equipment Underperformed

None of the equipment achieved consensus:

- Blade of the Bloodchief: 0% (cut all iterations)
- Heirloom Blade: 20% (only Card Advantage kept it)

Equipment is too slow for this deck's gameplan.

### 10. Removal Varied Most by Strategy

The biggest variance between iterations was in the removal suite:

- Mana Curve kept: Despark, Infernal Grasp (efficient)
- Removal Focus kept: Despark, Infernal Grasp, Bake into a Pie, Terror Tide, Return to Dust, Austere Command, Diabolic Tutor (maximum answers)
- Power Level cut: Despark, Infernal Grasp (considered "budget")

This is where your meta matters most.

## Recommendations

### For Most Players:

**Use the Core 62 (100% consensus) + Strong 5 (80% consensus) = 67 cards**

Fill the remaining 32 slots with:

1. The 7 flex cards (60% consensus)
2. Additional lands (to reach 36-37 total)
3. Meta-specific cards based on your local playgroup

### If Your Meta Is:

- **Combo-Heavy**: Add more interaction (Despark, Infernal Grasp, Austere Command, Diabolic Tutor for tutoring answers)
- **Aggro-Heavy**: Add more lifegain (Charismatic Conqueror, Welcoming Vampire, Falkenrath Noble)
- **Control-Heavy**: Add more threats (Mavren Fein, Bloodghast, Nighthawk Scavenger, Bolas's Citadel)
- **Casual/Budget**: Include more of the 60% cards and budget alternatives

### Cards to Consider Adding (Next Tier):

If you want to go beyond 99 or replace flex slots:

1. **Mavren Fein, Dusk Apostle** (40%) - Token generation
2. **Orzhov Basilica** (40%) - Additional mana fixing if curve allows
3. **Read the Bones** (40%) - Budget card draw
4. **Bloodghast** (20%) - Recursive threat
5. **Bolas's Citadel** (20%) - High-power engine if you can support the life cost

---

## Cards That Didn't Make The Cut (And Why)

### Absolutely Cut (0% consensus):

1. **Order of Sacred Dusk** - 8 CMC is unplayable even with convoke
2. **Butcher of Malakir** - 7 CMC too slow for modern Commander
3. **All tapped lands** - Speed is critical, entering tapped is a huge cost
4. **Budget drain effects** (Epicure of Blood, Marauding Blight-Priest) - Worse versions of Blood Artist/Vito
5. **Narrow removal** (New Blood, Bake into a Pie) - Too expensive or conditional
6. **Equipment** (Blade of the Bloodchief, Heirloom Blade) - Too slow to set up
7. **Weak 1-drops** (Vampire of the Dire Moon, Master of Dark Rites, Indulgent Aristocrat) - Low impact
8. **Conditional 4-drops** (Twilight Prophet, Redemption Choir, Bloodtracker) - Require too much setup

---

**Final Deck Power Level: Bracket 3**

All iterations agreed: This is a highly optimized casual deck with infinite combo potential, efficient tutors, powerful engines, and strong interaction, but lacks the fast mana (Mana Crypt, Jeweled Lotus) and free spells (Force of Will, Pact of Negation) typical of cEDH (Bracket 4).
