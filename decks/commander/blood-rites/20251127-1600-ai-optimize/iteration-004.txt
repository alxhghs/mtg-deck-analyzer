## Description
This vampire deck is built around powerful card advantage engines to outlast opponents. The core includes premium card draw (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena, Champion of Dusk, Twilight Prophet, Skullclamp, Pact of the Serpent) that keep your hand full. Every sacrifice generates value through death triggers (Blood Artist, Cruel Celebrant, Vraan) or direct card draw (Vampiric Rites, Village Rites, Dusk Legion Zealot). The deck includes tutors (Demonic, Diabolic) to find missing pieces and recursion (Nullpriest, Edgar, Carmen) to reuse threats. Token doublers (Mondrak, Teysa) and triggered ability doublers (Drivnod, Roaming Throne) multiply your value. Card selection tools (Preacher draws cards, Welcoming Vampire draws on tokens, Bloodtracker draws on death) ensure you always have resources. This grinds out opponents through pure card advantage.

**Estimated Bracket: 3** - Powerful card advantage engines (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena, Champion of Dusk), efficient tutors, infinite combo potential (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond/Vito), strong value generation, but no fast mana beyond Sol Ring.
