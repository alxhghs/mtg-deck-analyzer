## Description
This is the statistically optimal vampire aristocrats deck based on 5 AI-powered analyses with different strategic priorities. The 62 cards with 100% consensus (kept in all 5 iterations) form the absolutely essential core. These include the infinite combo package (Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond + Vito), premium drain effects (Blood Artist, Cruel Celebrant, Vraan), doublers (Mondrak, Teysa, Drivnod, Roaming Throne), card advantage engines (Necropotence, Phyrexian Arena, Champion of Dusk, Skullclamp), sacrifice outlets (Bartolomé, Viscera Seer, Yahenni, Vampiric Rites), and premium removal (Path to Exile, Swords to Plowshares, Anguished Unmaking). The manabase is rock-solid with all the best dual lands and minimal tapped lands. The 7 cards at 80% frequency provide additional support and are extremely reliable. The 10 cards at 60% frequency (Sanguine Spy, Forerunner, Falkenrath Noble, Dark Ritual, Despark, Infernal Grasp) can be adjusted based on your meta - include more removal if facing combo, more speed with Dark Ritual, or swap for alternatives if you prefer different interaction.

**Estimated Bracket: 3** - Optimized casual with infinite combo potential, efficient tutors, powerful card advantage engines, strong interaction suite, but no fast mana beyond Sol Ring and no free spells typical of cEDH.

## Usage Notes
- **Core 62 (100% consensus)**: These cards should ALWAYS be in the deck - there's universal agreement they're essential
- **Strong 7 (80% consensus)**: Very reliable includes (Charismatic Conqueror, Elenda's Hierophant, Welcoming Vampire, Sorin Lord, Damn, Myriad Landscape, 2 signets)
- **Flex 10 (60% consensus)**: These are the cards to adjust based on your local meta and playstyle (Sanguine Spy, Forerunner, Falkenrath Noble, Dark Ritual, Despark, Infernal Grasp)
- **Consider adding**: If you want different options, the next most frequent cards are Mavren Fein, Bloodghast, Nighthawk Scavenger, Sanctum Seeker, Drana (all appeared in 1-2 iterations)
